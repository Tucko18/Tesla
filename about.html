            <h1>Tesla is a technology and energy company founded in 2003 by Elon Musk, Marc Tarpenning, and Ian Wright. The initial idea of the company was to produce an electric sports car that could compete with gasoline-powered cars. In 2008, Tesla launched its first car, the Roadster, which was an all-electric sports car that had a range of 245 miles per charge, making it the longest-range electric car of its time.</h1>

                   Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. By producing electric cars and clean energy products, Tesla is helping to reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels and combat climate change.
